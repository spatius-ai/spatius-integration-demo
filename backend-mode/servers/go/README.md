# Backend Mode Backend (Go)

This repository does not provide a full Backend Mode implementation in Go.

Reason: Backend Mode includes `ASR -> LLM -> TTS + Server SDK bridge`, and maintaining full parity across languages creates heavy duplication.

Recommendation:

- Use `../python` for production or full verification.
- If Go is required, start from thin capabilities (token/proxy) and extend as needed.
